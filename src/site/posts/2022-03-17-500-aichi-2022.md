We are part of the Landing Pad program of the Aichi (Japan) Preferecture and 500 Global initiative. We had our Demo Day on Mar 17, 2022. The Program was a 6-week acceleration program where [19 Startups were selected](https://programs.500.co/accelerate_aichi/startups).

[Accelerate Aichi] by [500](https://500.co) Global consists of three types of programs which are all aimed at creating successful startups, building an innovation culture, and stimulating ecosystem growth in [Aichi Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aichi_Prefecture).

> Chosen by the Japanese national government as a part of the Global Startup Cities, Aichi aims to promote innovation and further develop new industries by welcoming cutting-edge technology startups from Japan and around the world.

It was a great experience meeting Startups from around the world intending to kickstart a relationship with Japan. Valinor Earth applied as an AgTech but pivoted and came as a ClimateTech Startup.

## About Aichi

Situated at the heart of Japan in between Tokyo and Osaka, Aichi Prefecture is known as one of the gateways to the Asian market for international business ventures. In addition, the business expenses are relatively low compared to other major metropolitan cities such as Tokyo and Osaka.

Aichi Prefecture was identified as a “startup ecosystem global hub city” by the Cabinet Office in 2020. The region is well-known for their mission-driven initiatives including designated market expansion offices that aim to help foreign startups set up new business and a startup support center that offers free coworking space and mentorship for startups.
