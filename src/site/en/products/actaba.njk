    <p>Working with the Government of Japan, we built <a href="http://www.actaba.jp/" target="_blank">Actaba</a>, a tool to create automatic polygons to track farmlands and calculate their utilization. We are able to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index">NDVI</a> (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and help farmers to find the optimal time to harvest a particular crop.</p>

    <p>Actaba is a result of our technology that uses satellite imagery backed data provided by <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/">JAXA</a> (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and <a href="https://www.restec.or.jp">RESTEC</a> (Remote Sensing Technology Center of Japan).</p>
