Based on our research, talks, and toiling along with farmers-in-the-field, we found that the most critical problem for farmers is access to credits at the right time, at an interest-rate favorable to them. More than 50% of the 120+ Million farmers do not have access to institutional bank credits and end up borrowing from local loan sharks at excessively high-interest rates.

We leverage technology - satellite imagery, soil testing (IoT & Chemical), compute public data, and private data to build **a credit-score for farmers.** This helps them get access to favorable credits, by connecting them to international lenders, such as Japanese, on our platform. In the fields, we work closely with partners who are already working directly with farmers.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we helped over 200 Indian farmers access to zero-interest loans. We also worked, and continue to help farmers connect to the right markets.
