By partnering with Agro-Businesses, large-scale farmers (mostly our Satellite Farm Watch customers), FPO (Farmer Producers Organizations), we help individual farmers and farm gig-workers with short-term (microfinance) loans.

We are building a credit-score system for the under-served, un-banked farmers to extend our finance outreach to the 120+ Million Indian farmers, and the other 145+ Million Agricultural Laborers.
