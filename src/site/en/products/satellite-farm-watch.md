We use Satellite imagery to track, monitor, and analyze to help farmers make smart and precision farming decisions.

We send reports to farmers with localized weather predictability, biomass mapping, monitor crop health and stress, water presence, and fertilizer application optimization.

Right now, we work closely with a few select large farmers. We have also begun helping a few Indian state governments with tracking and reporting crop-insurance frauds.
