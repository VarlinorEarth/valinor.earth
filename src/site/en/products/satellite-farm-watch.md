Using Satellite Imagery, we help farmers to track, monitor, and analyze to make smart and precision farming decisions.

We help farmers with localized weather predictability, biomass mapping, monitor crop health, water management, and fertilizer application optimization.

Right now, we work closely with a few select large farmers. We have also begun work on helping a few Indian state governments with satellite imagery to improve farming.
