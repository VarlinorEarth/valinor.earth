        <h3>Actaba, Japan</h3>
        <p>Working with the Government of Japan, we built <a href="http://www.actaba.jp/" target="_blank">Actaba</a>, a tool to create automatic polygons to track farmlands and calculate their utilization. We are able to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index">NDVI</a> (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and help farmers to find the optimal time to harvest a particular crop.</p>

        <p>Actaba is a result of our technology that uses satellite imagery backed data provided by <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/">JAXA</a> (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and <a href="https://www.restec.or.jp">RESTEC</a> (Remote Sensing Technology Center of Japan).</p>

        <h3>Sagri Finance, India</h3>
        
        <p>
          A <a href="/finance/">micro-finance credit system</a> for Indian farmers, to help them get loans when needed at a reasonable interest. Sagri is focused on giving loans to farmers, who may not have access to credits via the public and private banks.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are building a Farmer Credit Score, by levering our Satellite Imagery and Soil Testing Technologies. We assess the farmland productivity, history of produce, soil quality, etc. to build up a credit score. We give them loans based on the credit score.

        <h3>Tellus, Japan</h3>
        <p>Sagri needed to have better data and precise data about farmland’s result from the satellite, so, we went and installed a bunch of IoT devices on the farms.</p>
        <p>We corroborated our satellite data with factual ground data, to help farmers with much more accurate data with regards to their farmland.</p>
